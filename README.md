# TabInsight
#### Providing Analytical Insight in to Handhelds


## Underlying Idea

Handheld devices such as tablets have huge potential to revolutionize the classroom and the whole learnng process.
Governments and Non Profit Organizations are now providing school students  with handheld devices as way of augmenting the learning process or in some cases to replace text books (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/06/textbooks-tablets_n_2816567.html">more</a>)

The problem that TabInsight tries to solve is to track the tablet and app usage patterns so that Governemnts/ Organizations will have an insight into the usage patterns. (Don't get me wrong: no intrusion in to private space intended). By tracking usage patterns, Organizations will be able to determine how effective the learning apps are, understand how much they interest the students so that the ineffective apps can be swapped out for other similar apps. Tracking the tablet usuage patterns will help Organizations track when the handheld devices  are being used, which apps are being used when. This way they can ensure that the devices are being used for the intended purpose.

The text focuses enitirely on how  tabinsight can be used in the education sector. Fortunately, TabiNsight is versatile and not restricted to this use case. Any Organization that wants usage analytics on their devices can leverage this solution in some way.
